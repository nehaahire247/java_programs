/*
You are provided an array A of the size N that contains non-negative integers. Your task is to determine whether the number that is formed by selecting the last digit of all the N numbers is divisible by 10.



Input format

First line: A single integer N denoting the size of array A
Second line: N space-separated integers.
Output format

If the number is divisible by 10, then print Yes. Otherwise, print No.



Sample Input:

5

85 25 65 21 84

Sample Output:

No
