There are 7 floors in BH3 and only 2 lifts. Initially, Lift A is at the ground floor and Lift B at the top floor. Whenever someone calls the lift from the N th floor, the lift closest to that floor comes to pick him up. If both the lifts are at equidistant from the N th floor, then the lift from the lower floor comes up.



 Input Format:

First-line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

Next T lines contain a single integer N denoting the floor from which lift is called.

Output Format:
Output T lines containing one character "A" if the first lift goes to N th floor or "B" for the second lift.
