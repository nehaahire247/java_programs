        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        String customerName=scan.nextLine();
        String customerEmail=scan.next();
        String customerType=scan.next();
        String customerLocation=scan.next();
        call s=new call(customerName,customerEmail,customerType,customerLocation);
        System.out.println("Customer Details");
        System.out.println("Name:" + s.getName());
        System.out.println("E-mail:"+s.getEmail());
