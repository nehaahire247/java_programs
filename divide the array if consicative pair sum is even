question 
Nezzar and Rezzan are playing a game. Nezzar gave Rezzan an array A consisting of N integers. To win the game, Rezzan has to correctly tell whether it is possible to divide the entire array A into pairs such that the sum of each pair is even. If It is possible to divide the entire array A into pairs where each pair sum is even, Rezzan will say 'Yes' to Nezzar otherwise he will say 'No'. Rezzan got stuck in the problem, You being a friend of Rezzan help him find the answer



Input Format:

First line contains N, representing size of the array

Next N space separated integer value represents elements of an array

Output Format:

Print Yes If It is possible to divide the entire array A into pairs where each pair sum is even else No



Sample Input:

5

1 2 3 4 5

Sample Output:

No
