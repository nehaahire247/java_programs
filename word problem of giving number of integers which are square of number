/*
Watson likes to challenge Sherlock's math ability. He will provide a starting and ending value that describes a range of integers, inclusive of the endpoints. Sherlock must determine the number of square integers within that range.

Note: A square integer is an integer which is the square of an integer, e.g. 1,4,9,16,25.

Example

a = 24

b = 49

There are three square integers in the range: 25, 36, and 49. Return 3.
